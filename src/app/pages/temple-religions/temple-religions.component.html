                                    <p class="description">Hinduism is the religion of the majority of people in India and Nepal. It also exists among significant populations outside of the sub continent and has over 900 million adherents worldwide.</p>
                                    <p class="description">In some ways Hinduism is the oldest living religion in the world, or at least elements within it stretch back many thousands of years. Yet Hinduism resists easy definition partly because of the vast array of practices and beliefs found within it. It is also closely associated conceptually and historically with the other Indian religions Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Unlike most other religions, Hinduism has no single founder, no single scripture, and no commonly agreed set of teachings. Throughout its extensive history, there have been many key figures teaching different philosophies and writing numerous holy books. For these reasons, writers often refer to Hinduism as 'a way of life' or 'a family of religions' rather than a single religion.</p>

                                    <p class="description">Jainism is an ancient religion from India that teaches that the way to liberation and bliss is to live lives of harmlessness and renunciation.</p>
                                    <p class="description">The essence of Jainism is concern for the welfare of every being in the universe and for the health of the universe itself.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Jains believe that animals and plants, as well as human beings, contain living souls. Each of these souls is considered of equal value and should be treated with respect and compassion.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Jains are strict vegetarians and live in a way that minimises their use of the world's resources.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Jains believe in reincarnation and seek to attain ultimate liberation - which means escaping the continuous cycle of birth, death and rebirth so that the immortal soul lives for ever in a state of bliss.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Liberation is achieved by eliminating all karma from the soul.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Jainism is a religion of self-help.</p>
                                    <p class="description">There are no gods or spiritual beings that will help human beings.</p>

                                    <p class="description">Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that focuses on personal spiritual development and the attainment of a deep insight into the true nature of life. There are 376 million followers worldwide.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Buddhists seek to reach a state of nirvana, following the path of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who went on a quest for Enlightenment around the sixth century BC.</p>
                                    <p class="description">There is no belief in a personal god. Buddhists believe that nothing is fixed or permanent and that change is always possible. The path to Enlightenment is through the practice and development of morality, meditation and wisdom.</p>
                                    <p class="description">Buddhists believe that life is both endless and subject to impermanence, suffering and uncertainty. These states are called the tilakhana, or the three signs of existence. Existence is endless because individuals are reincarnated over and over again, experiencing suffering throughout many lives.</p>
                                    <p class="description">It is impermanent because no state, good or bad, lasts forever. Our mistaken belief that things can last is a chief cause of suffering.</p>
